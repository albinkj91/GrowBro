Notes:
  - Up to this point, any changes I have made can be considered
    licensed under CC0. So original licensing can be used with
    attribution necessary to the original author(s) only (this
    may change with future edits).
  - The "original" 192x160 tileset is Yar's original image, but
    positioning has been slightly offset.
